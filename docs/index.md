Current smart homes require many smart devices all reporting their status and collecting data. For many homes, the overhead and cost of replacing "dumb" appliances is not worth the new features that these new smart appliances provide. We would like to use a cheap single device placed in a per-room basis to monitor appliances and alert home-owners of unusual activity, like the fridge being left open, to "smartify" a home without replacing or upgrading all of its current appliances individually. We have achieved this on low power embedded device by monitoring ambient noises to classify which appliances are currently in use. We have successfully been able to classify home appliances with above 90% accuracy when they are in use by themselves, but future work is necessary before our system is robust enough to detect simultaneous appliances and truly compete with a home fully equipped with smart devices.
